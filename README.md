# Stock Market Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The "Stock Market Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project aims to predict future stock market prices utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical stock data, the project forecasts future price trends to assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**:  Programming language used for developing the project.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Keras**: For building and training neural network models.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating data visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and development.

## Features
- Data pre-processing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Implementation of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for price prediction.
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual prices.

## Data Sources
- **Yahoo Finance**: For historical stock price data.
- **Alpha Vantage**: For real-time stock price data (optional).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
3. **Install Dependencies**

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Data**: Download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance or another source and save the data in the data folder.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the command "jupyter notebook" and then open the stock_price_prediction.ipynb notebook.
3. **Train and Evaluate the Model**: Follow the steps in the notebook to pre-process the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
4. **Visualize the Results**: Use the provided visualizations to compare predicted prices with actual prices.


## Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting stock market prices. The LSTM model's performance is evaluated using MAE and RMSE metrics, and the results are visualized to illustrate prediction accuracy and trends.
